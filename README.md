# js_Pop_Quiz

## Description

In this project I wanted to put my knowledge of javascript to the test, by creating a test. I set up a simple HTML to display information on the screen and styled it with CSS. Once the start button is click the javascript file takes over and displays a question and list some options for the user to choose. At the end you can submit your score and track how well you've done.

Here is a screenshot of a quiz in progress:

[Deployed Page](https://johnfrom209.github.io/js_Pop_Quiz/)

## Usage

By going to the deployed page link, you can try out your knowledge about javascript on my quiz. Start by clicking on the "Start" button. Once you click the start button an event listener will start a timer. Then the js file grabs the first question and the options that come with the quesion. Clicking the submit button will compare the value of the selected answer and increase or decrease the score depending if you were right or wrong. After that another question is displayed on the screen until there are none left or you run out of time. At the end, you can submit your score to be saved on your local storage, which gets displayed after initials are submitted. On the score screen there is a button to refresch the page and start the quiz over.
